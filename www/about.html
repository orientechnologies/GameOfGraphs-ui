<h4>Game of Graphs</h4>

<p>
  Game of Graphs is a toy application, developed mostly for fun, to experiment with <a href="http://www.orientdb.com">OrientDB</a> graph database
  and <a href="http://visjs.org/">Vis.js</a> rendering library. In addition, for the front-end I used <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a>,
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">FontAwesome</a>

  The project has no commercial purpose and is released AS IS, with no warranty. (Please, don't be too critical about the code quality,
  it started as a toy and I did it in a few hours, literally)
</p>

<p>
  The sample database was created from Game of Thrones wiki  (<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki">Wikia</a> -
  just awesome!). The data import required some manual parsing of the wiki pages, so some data are not very accurate.
